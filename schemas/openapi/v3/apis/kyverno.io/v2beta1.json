The keywords are: \"true\", \"false\", \"null\", \"in\", \"as\", \"break\", \"const\", \"continue\", \"else\", \"for\", \"function\", \"if\", \"import\", \"let\", \"loop\", \"package\", \"namespace\", \"return\". Examples: - Expression accessing a property named \"namespace\": {\"Expression\": \"object.__namespace__ \u003e 0\"} - Expression accessing a property named \"x-prop\": {\"Expression\": \"object.x__dash__prop \u003e 0\"} - Expression accessing a property named \"redact__d\": {\"Expression\": \"object.redact__underscores__d \u003e 0\"} \n Equality on arrays with list type of 'set' or 'map' ignores element order, i.e. [1, 2] == [2, 1].
