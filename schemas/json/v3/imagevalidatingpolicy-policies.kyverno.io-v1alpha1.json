The value is null for DELETE requests.\n- 'oldObject' - The existing object. The value is null for CREATE requests.\n- 'request' - Attributes of the API request([ref](/pkg/apis/admission/types.go#AdmissionRequest)).\n- 'params' - Parameter resource referred to by the policy binding being evaluated. Only populated if the policy has a ParamKind.\n- 'namespaceObject' - The namespace object that the incoming object belongs to. The value is null for cluster-scoped resources.\n- 'variables' - Map of composited variables, from its name to its lazily evaluated value.\n  For example, a variable named 'foo' can be accessed as 'variables.foo'.\n- 'authorizer' - A CEL Authorizer. May be used to perform authorization checks for the principal (user or service account) of the request.\n  See https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/cel/library#Authz\n- 'authorizer.requestResource' - A CEL ResourceCheck constructed from the 'authorizer' and configured with the\n  request resource.\n\nThe `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata.name` and `metadata.generateName` are always accessible from the root of the\nobject. No other metadata properties are accessible.\n\nOnly property names of the form `[a-zA-Z_.-/][a-zA-Z0-9_.-/]*` are accessible.\nAccessible property names are escaped according to the following rules when accessed in the expression:\n- '__' escapes to '__underscores__'\n- '.' escapes to '__dot__'\n- '-' escapes to '__dash__'\n- '/' escapes to '__slash__'\n- Property names that exactly match a CEL RESERVED keyword escape to '__{keyword}__'.
