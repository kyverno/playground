The container either exited with non-zero status or was terminated by the system. Unknown: For some reason the state of the pod could not be obtained, typically due to an error in communicating with the host of the pod.\n\nMore info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#pod-phase\n\nPossible enum values:\n - `\"Failed\"` means that all containers in the pod have terminated, and at least one container has terminated in a failure (exited with a non-zero exit code or was stopped by the system).\n - `\"Pending\"` means the pod has been accepted by the system, but one or more of the containers has not been started.
